This rubric was developed for the _Students as Scholars_ initiative
at George Mason University
and first adapted by Louise Darling at Wellesley College.
This rubric is designed to evaluate the *process* of learning about scholarship
and in performing an undergraduate research or creative project.
This includes essential undergraduate learning outcomes
across three developmental levels:

1. Discovery:
   Understand how knowledge is generated and disseminated through scholarship,
   and the importance of scholarship to society.
2. Scholarly Inquiry:
   Articulate a scholarly question;
   engage in the key elements of the scholarly process;
   and situate the concepts, practices, or results of scholarship
   within a broader context.
3. Creation of Scholarship:
   Create and communicate knowledge from an original scholarly or creative project.

Efforts have been made to use language that is inclusive of diverse disciplines,
methods,
and projects.
Columns represent a student’s intellectual
and skill development in their respective discipline or field,
and can be used to assist the student in this development.

***Students as Scholars* Research Product Rubric**

This rubric was developed for the *Students as Scholars* initiative at George Mason University.
This rubric is designed to evaluate the *product* of an undergraduate research or creative project.
Efforts have been made to use language that is inclusive of diverse disciplines,
methods,
and projects.
Products may include written documents,
poster presentations,
oral presentations or performances,
artistic expressions,
and interviews.
Columns represent a student’s intellectual
and skill development in their respective discipline or field,
and can be used to assist the student in this development.
