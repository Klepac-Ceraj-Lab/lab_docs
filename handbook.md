## Overview

This document explains the role of an undergraduate research assistant
in the Klepac-Ceraj lab
and what you can expect from the experience.
It also explains our expectations of you
and details your responsibilities within our lab group.
Please read it carefully
and talk to Vanja Klepac-Ceraj or Kevin Bonham about anything that you do not understand
or that differs from your initial expectations.[^5]

While reading the details,
do not lose sight of the big picture.
You have an opportunity to work on scientific research
and to gain satisfaction from exploring a biological question
while interacting closely with your peers and faculty.[^5]
We want research to be an exciting and rewarding experience for all!

Every professor’s methodology is slightly different,
but about 90% of the way that I manage undergraduate research
is probably common with most science professors at undergraduate institutions.
It is also likely similar to the experience
that you would/will have as an undergraduate intern at a company.[^5]

### I. Performing a Research Project

#### IA. What is research?

Scientific research seeks to understand the world around us.
It starts with broad, open-ended questions,
like "can computers think?"
or "what causes cancer?"
We then choose a sub-problem that will give us insight towards the larger issue
but is more manageable.
Example,
"Does increased expression of protein X allow adult,
adipose-derived stem cells to be resistant to chemotherapeutic treatment?"
Throughout, we follow the scientific method in a continually iterative process.[^5]

Wellesley College’s mission includes undergraduate education
(which you are familiar with by now!)
and professional scholarship.
In the sciences,
scholarship primarily means research.
The research process involves
examining contemporary questions or problems in new ways
and publishing the results as peer-reviewed scientific papers.
At Wellesley tenured and tenure-track faculty members
like Vanja Klepac-Ceraj
are expected to teach courses **and** conduct research (and also do service).
In most scientific fields,
research is a team-based, highly-collaborative endeavor.

**Why might undergraduates want to perform research? What can they expect to gain from the experience?**

I believe research is the best way to learn things.
It is one thing to learn established material,
concepts and skills within a particular discipline.
It is entirely another to learn how to formulate interesting questions,
develop plans for answering those questions,
execute those plans,
analyze what was learned in the process,
and communicate your findings.
When you conduct research,
you are exploring questions for which you may not be sure answers even exist!
For these and other reasons,
research can be daunting but also very exciting
and rewarding (adapted from[^2]).

I find working with undergraduates to be a highly exciting
and rewarding experience.
Undergraduates are fresh, excited,
and often ask out-of-the box
and key fundamental questions about our biological questions
and research endeavors.
This keeps me invested, invigorated, and motivated
and continually reinforces my choice to pursue a career in academia
at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) (adapted from[^4]).

Undergraduate research,
with challenges and opportunities that are distinct from the classroom,
can be valuable for undergraduate students for a variety of reasons including ^(adapted\ from [^1] and [^5]):

1. *Development of laboratory skills*:
Undergraduate students can gain in-depth,
hands-on experience and training with a variety of instruments
and laboratory techniques that are not available in laboratory courses.
In the research laboratory,
students are often introduced to new instrumentation not present in lab courses
and/or receive more extensive training on instrumentation
and other laboratory techniques.
Such skills are highly sought by companies that employ STEM graduates,
and students with an extensive undergraduate research experience
have a competitive advantage in the job market
as well as applications for graduate or professional school.
2. *Pedagogical value*:
The challenges (intellectual and otherwise)
of independent research are quite different from those of the classroom.
An intense research experience
can develop critical thinking skills that complement classroom learning.
3. *Developing professional skills and relationships*:
Working as a research assistant is a good way to form a close,
professional relationship with a faculty member.
If you choose,
your faculty member can be a mentor, advocate, coach, etc.
not only while you are an undergraduate but well beyond!
The depth of the relationship you build
also lends itself to someone being able provide support
and to write strong letters of recommendation.

4. *Fellowships/Scholarships*:
Undergraduate research scholarships/fellowships are available at the College,
national, and international level.

5. *Career choices*:
Research experiences extend your education
in ways that are not possible with regular course work.
It can also provide you a more comprehensive understanding
of what a research scientist does,
helping you decide what you are interested in pursuing as a career.
Although classroom learning is important,
it does not adequately convey the challenges
and experiences of performing research.
Thus, those students who gain research experience
are better able to decide on the career/academic path
that best suits their interests and goals.

As a research assistant you are a valued
and essential part of the research team,
but you are not wholly responsible for managing the entire research process
or for independently publishing research papers.
One of the main goals of a research assistant is to learn the process of science
and to make a meaningful contribution towards a result.

***Who should perform undergraduate research?***

Curious and dedicated students
seeking to broaden their knowledge and skills,
those eager to learn more about science,
and students with a desire to engage in a challenging/rewarding experience.
Undergraduate research is beneficial,
but requires a commitment of time, energy, and effort from the student.[^1]

***What will I be doing? What are the expectations?***

Projects vary in scope depending on the student’s interests,
which can definitely change over time!
There are also several different types of undergraduate research positions in our lab,
each with different roles and expectations (see section II for specifics).

Throughout your work on a research project,
your thinking and behavior should be characterized by *exploration*.
First,
you should explore the space of research questions we are asking.
That is, we may start with one or several overarching questions,
but these are only starting points and guiding themes.
Every question suggests several others
and you should be practicing asking those.
You will also need to explore responses to those questions,
both the ones we ask together
and the ones you generate on your own.
In this respect,
you need to be willing to try things that may fail;
that is how we learn best.
Finally,
through reflection you need to explore what you learned
from your responses to the questions.
Do the results lay to rest one or more of the previous questions?
Do the responses suggest yet other questions?[^2]
Now rinse
and repeat!

Being a part of our lab group will offer you research experiences
and training opportunities that will help you to develop both personally
and professionally.
We are invested in our all our mentees
and committed to helping each member of our team
reach their long-term objectives,
no matter what those may be.

Broadly,

- You will perform "wet bench" research to address a biological question
  within cell biology (and subfields)
    - This includes designing, planning, and conducting experiments.
      You will also analyze your data
      and communicate your work to a variety of different audiences.
- Research in cell biology requires an enormous amount of troubleshooting
  and repeating of assays, instruments, etc.
  This is where you should expect to spend the majority of your effort.
    - You won’t do this work alone! Science is an incredibly collaborative endeavor!
- During our weekly group and/or individual meetings,
  you will present your progress from the past week,
  and we will establish milestones for the coming week.
- Your timeliness and thoroughness
  in completing these agreed-upon units of work
  will be reflected in my evaluation of you (via a grade or recommendation letter),
  but much more importantly,
  they will strongly influence the likelihood of the project's success.[^2]
- You will support our lab group
    - Presenting for visitors or interested students
    - Cleaning and maintaining the lab environment
    - Building a culture of safety in lab
    - Helping, teaching, and managing peer and near-peer research assistants

#### IB. Performing a Research Project

***Now that I’ve joined the lab, how do I get started?***

Research is very different from course work.
The biggest difference is
that nobody knows the answer to the problems that we are looking at!
In fact,
we do not always know if we are asking the right questions,
or whether it is possible to answer them.
It is more like detective work than a homework assignment.
You will grow to be a lot more independent than in a course,
with less structure.
This means that you have to be proactive about seeking information,
devising smaller experiments,
and structuring your workday.[^5]

Solving the problem in research
is often not as important as *how* you solve it.
A scientist has to seek rigorous solutions
that advance our understanding of the problem
and the field.
We also interact closely with prior work,
giving credit to previous, related studies
and often choosing to explore or not explore a direction
based on what has been done before.
A scientist must discuss
how his or her work differs from what has been previously done,
and to do that,
must also be aware of a huge body of work.[^5]

All individuals performing research
will work with the Principle Investigator (PI),
Vanja Klepac-Ceraj,
to create a research proposal/outline prior to starting the project.
A clear research proposal is necessary
to the design of an efficient project that will produce valid results.
Many of the problems that projects encounter
will be avoided if the steps needed to carry out the project
are thought through and specified prior to starting work.

The principal steps are:

1. **Identify a problem. Write down your biological question.**
    - Why is this project important?
    - What is the significance of the problem being addressed?
    - What is the question that you will have answered
    - when you complete your research project?
1. **Propose a clear, testable hypothesis.**
    - Make sure this is a valid hypothesis.
    - What do you think is the answer to your biological question?
    - Be sure you can explain why this is your hypothesis.
1. **Limit the scope of the research**.
    - You have a limited amount of time
      and must select a research project that is feasible to complete.
    - For example,
      most thesis students at both the undergraduate
      and graduate level propose 3-5 times more work than is feasible.
      (Vanja definitely did!)
1. **Thoroughly read the literature to determine
    what is known and not known about the problem.**
    - You should not repeat research that has already been published;
      instead, you should build on what is known from previous studies
      to gain the maximum novelty of your work.
    - The vast majority of your time in lab is spent researching your research!
      That is not to say that you will not also repeat experiments,
      both your own and previous research assistants’,
      to help validate the lab’s ideas
      and hypotheses.
1. **Identify the skills, information, supplies, and equipment
    needed to answer the question**
    - Select the methods needed to collect
      and analyze the data.
    - List any new equipment or expensive reagents necessary,
      so the cost of the project can be adequately determined.
    - Provide detailed methods to be used in all assays.
    - Explain in detail how the data is to be collected
      and what method of statistical analysis will be used.
    - Good, valid experimental design
      lays this all out before any data are collected
      but often after a small pilot study.
1. **Decide how your results will be presented**
    - Data can be presented in many different ways
      (charts, figures, graphs, tables).
    - Think about the best way to convey the results of your data to your audience
      before you have even collected any data!
1. **Specify the timetable and budget**
    - Describe a timeline that indicates how you expect your project to progress.
      How will you know if you are reaching your goals?
1. **Write out your proposed protocols in detail**
    - Describe step-by-step how you will perform your experiments,
      including the timeline for when studies will be performed.
    - Allot time for analyzing and interpreting your data.
    - Discuss this protocol with your PI thoroughly
      and confirm your plan before starting.

1. **Perform your study**
    - As you are performing your experiments,
      check in regularly (at least weekly) with your PI
      to go over the data as it comes in
      and to revise any protocols if necessary.
    - Do not wait until everything is complete before doing this,
      as a simple error early on could invalidate all of your data.
1. **Keep all data neatly organized in a laboratory notebook that remains in the lab.**

**What about when I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be doing?**[^3]

It is the responsibility of the research student
to find a way to advance your project!
It is not your PI’s responsibility
to track you down to give you work to do.
Often you will be facing a problem or question
and be unsure how to even begin.
Many times in research you just have to dive in,
take a few steps forward,
and try something without a clear idea of whether it will work.
That said,
this can be one of the hardest aspects of research endeavors.
If you are not sure what to do,
you can always ask a near-peer or your PI;
we are here to help!
Remember,it is always better to ask someone
than to be unproductive or uncertain about what to do!

Any work that is assigned should be completed in a timely manner.
If a research assistant will be delayed in completing a task
and/or is unsure of the timeline for completion,
please contact your PI to ask or clarify.

**How will my work
and contributions be recognized?**[^5]

Another benefit of working as a research assistant
is that it can be an important step towards a career in many scientific fields
(even beyond cell biology!).
If your experience is a productive
and successful one,
I will not only be writing letters of recommendation for you in the future
but actively recommending
and promoting you as best I can
for industry, graduate school, research positions, etc.
Also, on our lab group webpage,
we list the current and alumni research students.

As a prelude to peer-reviewed publication,
we often submit abstracts to present poster or short research talks at local
and national meetings.
Research students are often the primary or co-primary authors
of these abstracts with the PI as the last author.
You will always have the opportunity to present your research on campus
(at Ruhlman, for example).
If your work is being submitted to an off-campus conference,
you will have the opportunity to travel there
(usually with me and other members of the Wellesley community)
to present your work
and participate in other professional development activities.

When the lab is ready to publish a paper that benefited from your work,
you will be either given credit in the acknowledgement section
or be listed as a co-author.
Note though that a publication will typically happen after you have already graduated,
as research can be a slow process.
Also,
you should not automatically expect to be listed as a co-author
on papers reporting aspects of the experiments that you worked on,
as journals have strict requirements for authorship
often including participation in every aspect of publication,
which undergraduate research assistants may not meet.
Most importantly,
you should not feel bad if we do not coauthor a paper together!
That should be only one of the ways you evaluate your work
and your ability as a scientist.

#### IC. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)

Responsible Conduct of Research boils down
to having integrity in all aspects of research.
The Wellesley College Honor Code
dictates the very high integrity standard expected in your courses
and personal interactions.
The integrity standard in research is even higher.
Research works because everyone in the field reviews each other’s work
and trusts each other’s published results.
You absolutely must report results accurately and honestly.
You must show your data as produced by executing your experimental design.
It is completely unacceptable to edit result images
or alter a data set for any reason.
In research,
we have to be our own harshest critics,
verifying all results
and testing alternative hypotheses.[^5]

You absolutely must act ethically
and carefully in all of your work.
Having a project fail is a completely acceptable outcome,
but falsifying or misrepresenting results is beyond unacceptable.
Doing so will terminate your academic and scientific career.
The standard for scientific ethics
is different than the practices in other fields
and what you might expect from everyday life.
Plagiarism and copyright violations
are unacceptable in any form —
all relevant work must be cited and used with permission,
whether it is an idea, an image, data, or code.
Note that for copyright,
it does not matter whether a 3rd party work is on the Internet,
whether our use is non-commercial,
or whether you are a student.
Permission is still needed each
and every time you use or reference someone else’s intellectual contributions
and/or work.[^5]

Until research is published,
it is essential that our ideas,
plans, and data
are kept confidential.
Do not discuss your project or unpublished results
with anyone outside Wellesley College
without expressed permission of your PI.
Do not describe your work in a job application,
graduate school interview,
or on social media
without discussing it with your PI beforehand.
Do not discuss problems that you are working on
using mailing lists or internet forums,
and do not ask for external help
with research problems without asking first.

#### ID. Intellectual Property

As a rule of thumb,
assume that while you are working at Wellesley College,
all of your work products related to your scientific research
are legally owned by either the College or your PI,
even if you work on them outside of your regular hours.
This is standard Massachusetts law
and is what you would encounter in the vast majority of workplaces.
This is rarely an issue in academic research
because our goal is usually to publish our work
and not make a commercial product.
However,
very occasionally a student will work on a patentable technology,
and it is important to understand that you do not have ownership of that.
All experimental investigations,
even those in the theoretical or planning stages,
are the intellectual property of the Klepac-Ceraj lab and/or Wellesley College.
You may not take ideas, protocols, equipment, reagents, samples, etc.
from our lab without first discussing with the PI.[^5]

As mentioned above,
our work should generally be treated as confidential.
Submission of any type of document containing any of your scientific work
(e.g. abstract, proposal, manuscript, etc.)
should **never** occur before your PI (and **all other** co- authors)
have given final approval.
The order of authorship for all publications
and presentations is determined by the PI.
The PI should be the first or corresponding author on all submissions.

### II. Research Opportunities and Expectations  

There are several types of positions
available in the Klepac-Ceraj lab
for students interested in gaining research experience.
Each one has different expectations
(of both the student and of the PI).
Please read through and understand
before committing to a research position in the Klepac-Ceraj lab.

**Shadowing:**

This option is typically for younger students
who are limited in the time they can commit due to course load, etc.
Students who shadow in the Klepac-Ceraj Lab
are expected to attend and participate in lab meeting each week
and to find 2-3 hours a week to shadow a senior student
who is performing experiments/assays at the bench or microscope.

**Volunteer Research Assistants:**

Volunteer research assistants are expected to perform hands-on,
wet-bench labwork,
but the commitment is lower for both the student
and mentor than paid research or for-credit options.
They are expected to attend and participate in lab meeting each week
and to contribute 5-6 hours/week to laboratory work,
which includes background reading,
planning and executing experiments,
data analysis,
writing, etc.
The effort here is similar to a 250H or 350H (see below),
but the project will be directed more by the PI rather than the student.

**Work-Study Research Assistants:**

Work-study is not guaranteed to be an option each semester,
as the PI has to request to be considered
for one of only a few spots from the Department.
If possible,
work-study can fund a student for up to 5 hours/week in lab.
Work-study can be done solely
for routine tasks/chores/maintenance in lab
or to advance a research project.
If the latter,
the expectations below for research or individual study
at the 250H or 350H level apply.

**Research or Individual Study:**

There are several options for research for credit:
- 250H
- 250
- 350H
- 350
- 355+365 (Thesis Research)
- 360+370 (Senior Thesis Research)

In the Klepac-Ceraj lab most of these can be either BISC or BIOC credits.

Research for credit in the Klepac-Ceraj lab
is only open to students who have completed BISC 110/112 with lab.
Most students enrolling in research for credit
have also already spent one semester in the Klepac-Ceraj lab
either shadowing or as a volunteer research assistant (see above).

**You are expected to treat research for credit with the same time commitment
and respect you would give a course in your major
at a similar level (200- or 300-level).
The information in this and following sections
constitutes the syllabus for your research or individual study course.**

**Science Center Summer Research Program:**

This opportunity is to participate in research full-time during the summer.
This is a 9- or 10-week (depending on each year’s calendar),
35 hour-per-week paid job.
You must apply early in the preceding spring semester
following application instructions from the Science Center.
There will be professional development programing
scheduled throughout the program.
It is your responsibility to attend
and actively participate in these
in addition to your own research initiatives.

#### IIA. My expectations of you as an undergraduate research assistant

This includes students participating in all of the above opportunities.
Regardless of your role,
please treat your research experience as a job
and make it a priority.
We expect that research students will behave responsibly at all times.
Please remember that you represent our lab
and all stakeholders including your department/program
and the Wellesley College community.
Failure to abide by lab rules
and expectations will result in one warning/coaching session
prior to dismissal from the lab.

My goal is to help everyone in this group to become
a productive, creative and independent scientist.
I want you to be
passionate, kind, self-directed, and rigorous[^7].

**Expectations and Requirements:**

Guidelines and expectations for thesis students
follow these for 250/350
and also include the additional steps detailed after this section.

- Dedicate time each week to research, including
    - time in lab conducting laboratory-based experiments (majority of time)
    - reading literature
    - planning experiments
    - processing & analyzing data
- 250H and 350H: 5-6 hours per week (on average)
- 250 and 350: 10-12 hours per week (on average)
- While you are not directly graded on your data and results,
- there are expectations that you accomplish work in a reasonable timeframe.
- If you find you are having to repeat the same experiment
  over and over again,
  that does not constitute successful and productive research.
    - Are you planning sufficiently ahead of time?
    - Are you meeting with your peers and/or your PI regularly to discuss your progress?
    - Are you **thinking** about what you are doing
      (both ahead of time and during the wet bench work)?!?
- Stay abreast of the literature related to the project,
  particularly those papers published during the semester.
    - You may need to read the same piece of literature several times
      (and at several time points over the semester).
      This is completely normal! (and encouraged!)
- Attend and actively participate in –
  both as a speaker and an attentive listener –
  group lab meeting each week
- Individual meetings held on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.
    - You should discuss the scheduling and frequency
      of your individual meetings with your PI
      before the end of the first week each semester.
- All lab members are expected to be at group
  and individual meetings unless there is a conflict
  (i.e., you have another MANDATORY event, like a course or interview, that you must attend).
    - *Note that not placing/having the meeting in your calendar is not an acceptable excuse.*
    - If you cannot attend a meeting due to a conflict in your calendar (e.g.,
      you find out that you have an interview or coach schedules an extra practice),
      notify your PI ASAP (more than 3 days ahead).
    - If you cannot attend a meeting due to an emergency or unforeseen reason
      (e.g., illness or family emergency),
      you are still responsible for notifying your PI ASAP.
- Maintain a clear, concise, thorough, and well-kept laboratory notebook
  from which others are able to find protocols and data.
    - Your lab notebook must be kept up-to-date throughout the semester.
    - The Klepac-Ceraj lab will provide you with a notebook.
- Be a good lab citizen by following the rules and policies outlined in this document
    - clean up after yourself
    - respect the work and space of others in the lab and in meetings
    - properly treat group and shared equipment
    - let your PI know well in advance of when new supplies need to be ordered
    - etc
- Research or individual study students will create and complete
  a tangible written research product each semester.
    - The content and due date of the report
      should be discussed and agreed upon with your PI
      no later than one month before the end of finals.
    - The latest due date is 5 PM on the last day of final exams each semester.

_Written Research Product Guidelines_

Depending on the nature of your project
and how it has progressed over the semester,
there may be very good reason to deviate from the suggestions below.
This is why it is essential to agree with your PI
on the nature of your final, written research product
at least one month before the end of finals.

For 250 and 350s,
students will most often write an 8-10 page (minimum) paper,
which describes the work conducted during the semester.
Accurate and appropriately cited literature references
must be included and are not part of the 8-10 page count.

For 250H and 350H,
the paper may only include some of the sections below
and should be 6-8 pages (minimum).

Please understand that your writing
requires a lot of work from both yourself and others,
especially when you have first joined the lab.
We absolutely want to help you learn how to become an effective science writer!
At the beginning of the process,
this often requires heavy rewriting of your drafts.
Please do not be offended by
edits/suggestions, comments, etc.;
everyone starts here!

As an example,
a 250/350 paper could contain:

- An **introduction section**,
  stating the purpose of the project,
  your biological question and hypothesis (as applicable),
  and relating those to other work both within and outside the Klepac-Ceraj lab.
- An **experimental section**, including a **materials and methods** subsection,
  highlighting new protocols and procedures and referencing older protocols
  from papers, the "official" lab protocols,
  other students’ notebooks, theses, etc.
- A **results and discussion section**
  that presents and interprets summarized, salient data
  that have been properly processed and analyzed.
- A **conclusions and future directions section**
  that clearly outlines the next steps you (or a subsequent student)
  would take to move your project forward.

### IIB. Additional expectations for thesis students

Undertaking thesis work is a serious commitment
of intellect, time, and energy
for both the student and advisor,
but is a highly rewarding experience.
Be sure to discuss your interest in thesis work early
(in fall of your junior year).
Thesis students in the Klepac-Ceraj Lab
should participate in the Science Center Summer Research Program
during the summer before their senior year.
The Klepac-Ceraj lab welcomes students completing thesis research
as well as honors theses in many different disciplines. Interested students should talk with their advisor (me) before committing to undertake thesis work and discuss all possible options of doing research in the VKC lab. For example, some students decide that they would rather be working on publishing a paper instead of writing a thesis.
Although the thesis timeline and requirements
may vary between academic departments,
all thesis students in the Klepac-Ceraj Lab
will have similar expectations and deadlines.
These may be in addition
to adhering to College, department, and/or program-defined
guidelines and deadlines
for written theses and thesis defenses.
Adherence to the thesis structure in the fall semester
is critical for approval to continue work in the spring.

1. Thesis students are expected to maintain
   weekly or bi-weekly individual meetings with your PI
   to discuss progress, experimental results, etc.
1. Before the end of September,
   you should develop and share with your PI
   a document to outline your proposed thesis work.
1. In September, you should discuss with your PI
  your suggestions for thesis committee members.
1. You are responsible for ensuring your committee has at least three members
   (including your PI)
   and fulfills the requirements of your department/program
   (BISC, BIOC, NEURO, etc.).
1. By the end of September, you should have finalized your thesis committee,
   received affirmative commitments from the members,
   and  scheduled a date for your first committee meeting.
1. Thesis students must have a first, full committee meeting before October 15th.
   You will prepare a formal presentation (\~15 min.) for this meeting.
   You need to allow adequate time for your PI to review this presentation
   and for you to practice ahead of your committee meeting.
   Written documentation (1-2 pages) outlining
   your plans, previous work, research design, and timeline
   will also be helpful for your committee.
1. You should arrange to remain on campus during Wintersession
   during which you will work full time on your thesis
   (experiments and/or writing).
1. At the end of Wintersession, a "final" draft of your introduction
   or another mutually agreed upon section(s) is due to your committee
   ahead of your spring meeting which must be held before February 15.
   Again, you need to allow adequate time for rounds of revision
   with your PI ahead of the due date.
1. When the PI decides the project is applicable,
   thesis students will be expected to present their work
   in the Biochemistry Program’s Annual Research Retreat held during Wintersession.
1. Students will also present their work at the Ruhlman Conference.
   Please ensure you submit an appropriate abstract before the due date.
   Remember that your PI needs adequate time to review
   and approve the abstract before submission.
1. Your final thesis document is due towards the end of April.
   Please have your "final" draft,
   which has been edited by someone else for both scientific content
   and writing style, grammar, etc.
   to your PI at least 10 days before the final submission deadline.
1. Your final thesis presentation is an oral defense (\~20 min.)
   scheduled during reading period.
   Please have a "final" version of your slides to your PI
   at least one week before your defense
   to allow for revisions and rehearsal presentations.

The nature of a thesis is typically more independent
than the research you have likely completed thus far.
At this point you are likely confident and successful
in performing many experiments.
However,
designing a complete research study is challenging.
You will need to do a large amount of background reading
to both craft your introduction and to defend your research plan.
At this point,
the ideas and hypotheses you present
should represent novel, independent thought
and not simply the "party line" of the Klepac-Ceraj lab.
I strongly recommend reading 3-5 papers per week
during the fall semester
to provide a strong foundation for your work.
I would be more than happy to make recommendations, etc.
on any part of your thesis work,
and I am excited to support your scientific endeavors!

#### IIC. Expectations of me as your advisor

I promise to care about you and your work.
I will always make time to talk with you about your research
and/or your academic training.
Although I will not be available at the drop of a hat,
I will always be available for at least 30 minutes once a week
for you with advance notice.
It will generally be much more than that,
but I will commit to a minimum of 30 minutes in even the worst weeks.

I will advise you on how to proceed
according to the career path that you select
(e.g., how to apply for med-school, grad school, how to get a research job, etc.).
Alternatively,
if I am not familiar with the career path you have chosen,
I will refer you to people and/or resources that can help to guide you.

I will read and comment
on any abstract, thesis manuscript, or other written materials
you give me within two weeks.
It will generally be in less time than that,
but I can guarantee within two weeks.
**Please get these to me at least this far in advance of your deadline.
I will go through your drafts at least two times.**

I will always accurately tell you about your performance.

I will provide you with resources for your research
provided that they are available to me,
your project has been approved,
the expense is reasonable given the laboratory priorities,
and, for a thesis project,
you are actively pursuing further funding for it.

#### IID. Evaluation and rubrics

If you chose to do research for credit,
including thesis work,
you will be receiving a grade for your work.
**It is not a given that this grade will be an A or A-.**
Grades in research are earned through hard work and perseverance,
just as they are in your Wellesley courses.

In general,

- A-level work is **conspicuously excellent**,
  consistently meets all of the expectations and requirements listed above
  and throughout this document.
  The final, written product for the semester is on time,
  professional, scholarly, excellent work.
- B-level work regularly meets most of the expectations and requirements
  listed above and throughout this document.
  The final, written product for the semester is on time,
  professional, scholarly, good work.
    - Students who are late to meetings,
      fail to communicate schedule changes on more than one occasion,
      and who ask to delay mutually agreed upon deadlines are performing B level work.
- C-level work fails to regularly meet some of the expectations and requirements
  listed above and throughout this document.
  The final, written product for the semester is average work,
  unprofessional, not scholarly, and/or is unsuccessful
  in addressing most of the aspects/sections described above.

It is critical that you understand that completing research in
and of itself does not constitute excellent work.
Nor is it necessary to always get "good" data
to be considered an excellent researcher.
I evaluate research students evenly
on both the process of research as well as on the research product
(typically a written document).
There is a rubric[^6] below for each of these to help set clear expectations for evaluation.

<!-- NOTE: this section (rubrics) has not been formatted... tables need a lot of work
I split it out into `handbook_rubrics.md`-->

[**_Students as Scholars_ Research Process Rubric**](handbook_rubrics.md)

### III. Meetings and Presentations

#### IIIA. Weekly Group Meetings

**Introduction:** We will have weekly group meetings.
The purpose of our weekly lab meetings is to[^8]:

1. Share ideas
1. To practice communication skills
1. To foster a sense of participation
1. To practice team problem-solving and decision-making
1. To foster critical thinking
1. To help each other to advance projects
1. To celebrate individual and team achievements

For each lab meeting, we will have a set agenda
and we will start and end on time.
It is critical that you come prepared
and ready to share your work and ideas.
The lab meetings are a chance for the lab to tackle problems and issues
faced by our lab mates.
We will start our meetings by lab announcements and lab administrivia.
Then, I would like everyone to provide a short update on their project.
Two students will give a 15 min formal presentation on their project.
These formal presentations provide a chance
to present ideas and get feedback in more depth.
Please prepare no more than 10 slides,
with time for questions and discussion.
You should have a slide or two explaining your project.
The rest of the talk can be focused on problematic data,
confusing findings or analyses that did or did not work.
If there’s a useful paper or you have an idea for your project,
you can present that as well.

#### IIIB. Individual or Small Group Meetings

**Introduction:** We will have individual or small group meetings.
The purpose of these meetings is to focus on your project in more detail,
help you trouble shoot any problems that you encountered in your research,
and help you move your project forward.
To prepare for each individual meeting,
please answer these five questions in the Google Doc
(each student has an individual document).

1. What are the goals of the meeting?
1. What did you accomplish last week?
1. what are you trying to accomplish next?
1. What can I do to help you get there?
1. What are the next steps?
1. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?

Please prepare this document at least the evening before our meeting
so that Kevin or I have a chance to review it.

#### IIIC. PowerPoint Presentations (or Google Presentations)

**Introduction:** Well-planned and prepared slides
can greatly enhance a lecture or scientific report
by clarifying and emphasizing the points made by the speaker.
Legibility is the key to effective slide presentation.
Illegible slides can distract or even irritate the audience.

1. All slides should be generated using PowerPoint software.
1. Use standard templates with solid colors and avoid fancy borders.
   Also avoid the overkill of too many
   meaningless colors, patterns, and graphics in one frame.
1. Contrasting colors work best.
   In a dimly lit room, use a dark background color such as dark blue,
   with white or yellow text, which is more readable.
   In a brightly lit room, lighter background colors
   with black or dark text work better.
1. Brevity and simplicity are essential.
1. Upper and lower case lettering is more legible than all capital letters.
   Use san-serif fonts such as Helvetica or Arial,
   which show up more clearly when projected than finer fonts
   such as Times or Times Roman.
   An exception should be made if it is critical to delineate
   the lowercase `l` from an uppercase `I`.
1. Vary the size of lettering to emphasize main heads and subheads
   but avoid using more than three type sizes per frame.
   Try to maintain the same or similar type size from frame to frame
   even if some frames have less copy.
1. Emphasize only one major point on each slide:
   Try to keep the format simple.
   Break down complicated material into a series of simple slides.
1. Whenever possible use graphics rather than tables of data
   or lines of text.
1. When inserting images, remember that most digital projectors
   cannot project higher resolution than \~1920x1080 pixels,
   so keep your images smaller than this size
   to minimize the total size of your file.
1. Remember the colorblind audience;
   try not to use red and green in your slides
   if they must be differentiated from each other.
   If you choose to do so for microscopy images,
   be prepared to also orally explain the data in sufficient detail.
1. Keep slide art simple and bold. Avoid redundancy.
   Avoid animated lettering.
1. Proofread all slides carefully and be sure to run a spell-check on your document.
1. Please upload all your presentations to a lab folder.

### V. RULES, POLICIES and PROTOCOLS

#### VA. LABORATORY RULES and POLICIES

**Introduction:** In order to make your experience in the lab
a pleasant one for all concerned,
it is expected that you will make a sincere effort
to develop good work habits and to exercise basic lab courtesy.
Since there are usually several people
working on different projects in the lab simultaneously,
it is important that everyone abides by certain rules.

*Please read
and make sure you understand the following.*

These rules are in place to maximize everyone’s experience in the lab,
including other members of the research team
and those in other Wellesley labs,
as well as other stakeholders who partner with us throughout the research process.

**RULE 1: CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF!**
Please keep in mind that nearly all work spaces are shared
and you are solely responsible for cleaning up
any area or equipment that you have used.
We share bench spaces in this lab
so it is imperative that we keep the lab clean and uncluttered.
*Work areas in the laboratory must be cleaned after use*.
Leave the bench top in the condition you would expect it to be found.
More specifically:

1. If you spill any reagents (liquid chemicals) on anything,
   wipe it off with disinfectant solution (soap and/or 10% bleach solution)
   and a damp paper towel or sponge.
   If you have never cleaned anything before,
   ask the Principal Investigator or a another lab member.
1. Put down a lab diaper or chux pad when using materials
   that will stain or adhere to the bench top.
1. Drawers and cabinet doors must not be left open.
1. Discard all empty glove boxes, syringe and pipette wrappers, used gloves, etc.
   Do not let them accumulate on the bench top.
   The VKC lab recycles! Cardboard must go down to the loading dock.
   Paper can be placed in the small recycle bin in lab near the desks
   and then taken to the larger bin near the printer when full.
   Styrofoam is recycled outside the doors near the elevators
   and loading dock on the ground floor.
   Plastic must be thoroughly rinsed
   and labels must be removed or defaced before recycling.
1. All hazardous chemicals and waste must be disposed of properly.
   See detailed sections for handling biohazardous
   and chemically hazardous waste.
1. Once you are finished, wipe down the area you have used
   and remove any supplies that you brought to the area.
   Please keep your bench spaces clean when you finish your work for the day.
1. Microbial plates with mold or other nasty microorganisms growing on them
   should be wrapped with parafilm
   or put in a Ziploc bag before you throw them away.
1. Culture plates at 4˚C do not last forever!
   If it is important to keep an organism,
   freeze it down as soon as possible in glycerol stock at -80˚C.
   After no more than two weeks,
   re-streak from –80˚C to ensure your organism is viable
   and then throw the old plate away.
1. Old PCR products:
   you should periodically clean up your samples from the fridge,
   especially if you know that you will not use them any longer.
   Also, EVERYTHING has to be labeled.
1. Recycling: Our recyclables categories
   include only items appropriate for the recycling standard for campus.
   A paper collection bin is located down the hall from lab.
   There are large bins for all types of recyclables
   near the Science Center loading dock.
   Note that all plastic and glass bottles must be thoroughly rinsed out,
   and all the labels must be removed or covered,
   before being placed in recycling bins.

**RULE 2: FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS OR ASK FOR HELP.**
Always follow instructions given to you
by the principal investigator or the laboratory manager.
If you are unsure of something
(or have been given contradictory advice/instructions),
please ask for help.
Do know that communicating via Slack
is often the fastest way to get the information.
I also maintain an open-door policy
and will respond to texts.
Please respect that I will answer emails promptly
between 9 am and 5 pm on Monday through Friday.
Outside of work hours is family time,
and my phone and computer are not always accessible.

**RULE 3: DO NOT BREAK LABORATORY RULES
BECAUSE THE PI OR LAB MANAGER IS NOT WITH YOU IN THE LAB.**
The rules are there
to protect you, other people in lab, and the continuation of research
in the laboratory.
Breaking a rule can result in a lower grade for independent study,
and/or termination of any paid/volunteer internship in the laboratory.
The consequence of breaking a rule
will be determined by the PI on a case-to-case basis.

**RULE 4: FOLLOW THE LABORATORY SAFETY INFORMATION.**
Occasionally we work with hazardous chemicals.
It is important to follow safety protocols down to a letter.
Do not touch anything in the hood with bare hands.
Do not place non-laboratory items in the hood,
or place things from the hood area onto other areas.
Always remove your gloves before touching the telephones or doorknobs.
Properly dispose gloves and chemicals.
Wearing open-toed shoes or shorts in these areas violates OSHA regulations.

General safety: All lab employees,
are required to take the Wellesley safety training.
They should also take time on their first day
to peruse the Wellesley [Safety website][2],
including specifically the safety manuals,
how to access [Material Safety Data Sheets][3], etc.
Consult with the laboratory PI at any time
regarding any concerns you have about chemicals you are using.
Ultimately, your safety is your own responsibility.
Take the initiative to determine the potential hazards around the lab,
and feel free to ask for help.
Know where the information is in the lab.

**RULE 5: BE RESPONSIBLE.**
If you make a mistake, please do not hide it.
Hiding it will likely make the situation much worse.

**RULE 6: RESPECT PRIVACY.**
Do not give any personal information
about others working in the laboratory
to anyone,
including home phone numbers, home addresses, etc.

**RULE 7: TAKE NOTES. LOTS OF THEM.
ALWAYS THINK WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU WERE READING YOUR PROTOCOLS/LAB NOTEBOOKS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME**
Lab notebooks: You *must* log all of your wet-lab experiments
in detail in your lab notebook.
For computer-based work,
you can keep an electronic lab notebook,
but you need to share it with me.
Lab notebooks may not leave the laboratory for more than 30 minutes.

**RULE 8:** **REFRIGERATOR and FREEZER USE.**
All items placed in laboratory refrigerators and freezers
must be labeled with the date, contents, and 3-4 initials
(ex. 1-10-13; anti-FLAG mmAb; VKC).
Freezer space can be limited
so store only those items that are absolutely necessary to keep in -20°C
and -80°C freezers.
Items that are not labeled may be discarded without notice.
In addition,
in the next few months,
we will re-establish the exact procedure for filing of strains,
plasmids, and oligonucleotides.

**RULE 9:** **EQUIPMENT.**
No laboratory equipment is to be disassembled, "repaired", or otherwise modified.
Do not use tape to fasten anything
to either equipment or bench tops
without removing it before it dries and becomes permanent.
Please ask before borrowing something from another person's project
and return it in its original condition.
Use **of any piece** of equipment is not allowed
without individual training and the approval of the Principal Investigator.

**RULE 10: WORK IN THE EQUIPMENT ROOM and OTHER LABORATORIES.**
It is absolutely important that you use the best manners possible
when working in the shared equipment room
and in other researchers' laboratories.
Remember,
by allowing you to work in their lab or by letting you use their equipment,
they are doing *you* a favor.
Be sure you have **the permission of the principal investigator (not just a lab member)**
before performing work in their laboratory.
Please inform your Principal Investigator
before you begin using shared equipment or that of another lab.
Always introduce yourself to others working in the lab.
Never use reagents without permission.
Replace all borrowed reagents or supplies
and clean up after yourself.
If you must use a specific piece of equipment,
be sure to arrange for training
and use at a specific time at *their* convenience.
Always show up on time (or cancel your time if you must)
and leave the equipment in the condition it was found.

**RULE 11:** **LABORATORY SECURITY.**
In the spirit of collaboration and congeniality,
we often leave the laboratory doors open or unlocked.
Please do not leave any valuables in lab!
All laboratories are restricted to students and employees only.
If you are issued any keys,
they must returned when your research period has been completed.
All visitors must be approved by the Principal Investigator.

Avoid working in the laboratory wing alone and/or outside of "reasonable" hours.
No science is important enough to put yourself at risk!

**RULE 12: FIRE ALARM.**
In the event the building fire alarm sounds,
please follow this procedure in as timely a manner as possible,
but remember your primary goal is to remove yourself
and your labmates from danger as quickly and safely as possible.

1. Turn off any hot plates, microwave ovens, Bunsen burners, etc.
   that are in use.
1. Exit the building by the nearest appropriate fire exit.
   While in L307, this is likely to be out onto the catwalk
   and down the fire stairs.
1. Once outside the building,
   our lab group will gather on the far side of Mozart III
   (the metallic, geometric sculpture)
   for the purpose of accounting for all lab members
   present at the time of the fire alarm.
   Note that if the Principal Investigator is coming from her office,
   it will take her some time to reach the meeting point.
   Feel free to text/email all lab members that you got out safely.

**RULE 13: THROW TRASH –
NOT FOOD ITEMS/WRAPPERS OR DRINK CONTAINERS -
IN THE TRASHCAN.**
The trashcans are for laboratory trash,
not for your personal trash that was in your bag/pocket.
As eating/drinking is not allowed in the laboratory
(see laboratory safety information),
it is also not allowed to throw away
items related to eating/drinking
(even if they were not consumed in or near the laboratory)
in the trashcans.
Do not throw food/drink related items
in trashcans that are in the hallway outside of the laboratory
or in trashcans of other (teaching) laboratories.
If the trashcan inside the laboratory is (almost) full,
switch it out with the empty one in the hallway right next to the door
(it will get emptied by the custodians).
If it is at the end of the day and you are preparing to leave,
switch the trashcan independent of whether it is full or not.

**RULE 14:** **COMPUTER USE.**
The Klepac-Ceraj Laboratory will provide a computer for general use
(word processing, graphics, statistics, etc.),
which is generally available on a first come,
first served basis.
Be sure to backup any important materials to a secondary storage location
(memory key, network server, external hard drive)
after each session.
In addition,
the data officer will back the entire computer
up to an external hard drive weekly.
Do not install extraneous programs.
No games are allowed on any of the lab computers.
Display of websites containing pornographic or hate-oriented material
is absolutely prohibited.
The following software packages are **required**
for laboratory use to make all files compatible with the research group:

-   Word-processing: **MS Word**
-   Shared documents and other file types: **Google Drive**
-   Email: **Gmail**
-   Reference manager: **Endnote**
-   Presentations: **MS PowerPoint**
-   Figures: **Adobe Illustrator**
-   Graphing: **MS Excel** (Plot colors/style can be modified using Adobe Illustrator)
-   Spreadsheets: **MS Excel **
-   Statistics: **R or STATA**
-   Mathematics: **Matlab** or **Mathematica**
-   Programming: **Matlab**
-   Image analysis: **Instrument specific software,** **ImageJ,** **MATLAB**
-   Virus Checking: **McAfee (available from Wellesley ITS** <http://new.wellesley.edu/lts/techsupport/windows>**)**

Always back up the information on your computer on a regular basis.
There are several ways to do this,
including DVD, memory key, external hard drive, and network storage.

**RULE 15: PUBLICATION POLICY and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.**
All publications or conference abstracts to be submitted
must be completely approved by the Principal Investigator and *all* co-authors.
The order of authorship for all publications and presentations
is determined by the Principal Investigator.
The Principal Investigator
should be the first or corresponding author on all submissions.

All experimental investigations,
even those in the theoretical or planning stages,
are the intellectual property of the Klepac-Ceraj lab.
You may not take ideas, protocols, equipment, reagents, samples, etc.
from our lab without first discussing with the Principal Investigator.

**RULE 16: TRAVEL POLICY.**
Both Wellesley College and the Principal Investigator
strongly support student travel to scientific conferences and meetings.
However, there are limitations to our funding
as well as strict policies that must be followed
when planning and taking travel.
Please see the Principal Investigator for more details.

**RULE 17: SUMMER RESEARCH and THESES.**
We will regularly have students working in lab during the summer months,
with some paid positions available
through the Science Center Summer Research Program
(applications due every February).
Summer students must have previously volunteered in the lab
for at least a semester.
Please be thoughtful and honest about your time commitment,
so everyone can tailor the plans and expectations accordingly.

**Thesis work is an exciting and substantial undertaking
to be taken after serious consideration by both the student and the mentor/PI.**
Please express your interest
in potentially exploring the thesis option with your PI early.
**Minimally, you will need to participate in summer research (full-time)
during the summer between your Junior and Senior year.**
The qualification for summer research also applies,
hence you need to have previously volunteered in the lab as well.
In your senior year,
the thesis cannot be added as a 5th course (thus you can maximally take 3 courses each semester).
**It is strongly encouraged to register for just 2 courses
and the thesis in the Spring semester of your senior year;
you are expected to be on campus full-time, with no other commitments,
for winter session and spring break to collect & analyze your data.**

**RULE 18: FINAL CLEAN UP BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE.**
When your time in the lab is through,
you must thoroughly clean up any remnants from your project.
**All original data notebooks and specimens must be left in the laboratory**.
Please let your Principal Investigator know
where any data or specimens are during your exit interview.
Any specimens, papers and other items left behind
and not clearly marked "SAVE"
will be discarded.
Be sure to also clean out any items from the refrigerators and freezers.
All laboratory property and keys must be returned.

#### VB. Laboratory Safety

**If there is ever any question about safety, ask before you begin!
_Every question is appropriate and valuable!_**

All information here is supplemental to and does not override
[Wellesley’s Laboratory Safety][4]
policies, guidelines, and requirements.

You are responsible for reading and understanding
the information in the above website.
In addition,
there will be additional, mandatory trainings
for students working in research labs at Wellesley.

**LABORATORY ATTIRE and BEHAVIOR**

1. Absolutely no food or drink in lab… ever… period!
1. You must wear close-toed shoes
1. Long pants are best
1. Wear a lab coatand gloves
1. Pull back long hair and remove or restrain dangling jewelry
1. Plan first, act second, and take your time in lab
1. Promptly clean up and spills
1. Label everything!

Failure to follow the above will result in one warning/coaching session
before you will be terminated from the lab.

**PERSONAL PROTCTIVE EQUIPMENT**

1. PPE is an essential element of primary containment and laboratory safety.
    - This includes gloves, lab coats, protective eyewear, etc.
    - It is the individual student/employee’s responsibility
      to ensure the use of appropriate PPE.
1. **At a minimum**_,
   laboratory personnel should **_wear gloves and a laboratory coat_**
   whenever handling biological agents or cells and tissues.
    - The use of gloves should be based upon chemical resistance charts
      and the recommendation of the chemical’s manufacturer (consult MSDS sheets).
    - Gloves are made from various materials
      that resist chemicals in different ways.
    - Gloves are rated based on 3 criteria: degradation,
      breakthrough time, and permeation rate.
      A glove that is well suited for a particular procedure
      may prove to be a dangerous choice for a different procedure.
    - Various types of gloves are available in the lab.
      Nitrile and/or latex gloves are available for personnel.
      Cryogloves are available for users of cryogenic materials.
      Heat-resistant gloves are available in for users of the autoclave
      or other heated materials.

| **choose NITRILE gloves if using**                                        | **choose NEOPRENE gloves if using**                                        |

   CO₂ tanks are used to maintain gas levels in incubators
   and are kept in cell culture rooms.

**BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIALS**

Research in our laboratory may include
the handling, culture, and/or manipulation of recombinant DNA (rDNA),
bacterial cells (K-12 *E. coli* strains),
and mammalian cell lines at Biological Safety Level 1
as well as human cell lines at Biological Safety Level 2.
Occupational exposure to such cells
will occur during the process of culturing cells
and during subsequent harvesting and processing.
The procedures utilized in this laboratory do not involve
human, animal, or plant pathogens of any kind.

The Principal Investigator (Vanja Klepac-Ceraj)
has registered this "Recombinant DNA and Infectious Agent Research"
with the Wellesley College Institutional Biosafety Committee
and will provide copies of the approved proposal upon request.

and logbook to keep track of our reagents
and chemicals.

- All containers must be labeled (in addition to manufacturers’ labels)
  the date received, the date opened, the expiration date, and 3-4 initials.
- Chemicals should not be stored on high shelves
  and large bottles should be stored no more than two feet from floor level.
- No chemicals should be stored directly on the floor.
- Prior to the use of any chemical,
  you should be familiar with information (i.e. [Safety Data Sheets])
  on proper handling, storage and disposal of that chemical.
- Chemicals shall be segregated by compatibility.
- Storage of chemicals at the lab bench or other work areas shall be kept to a minimum.
- Any chemical mixture shall be assumed to be as toxic as its most toxic component.
- Substances of unknown toxicity shall be assumed to be toxic.
- All waste disposal containers must be kept closed when not in use
  and stored in an appropriate spill containment tray.
- Carry glass containers in specially designed bottle carriers or a leak resistant,
  unbreakable secondary container.
- When transporting chemicals on a cart,
  use a cart that is suitable for the load
  and one that has high edges to contain leaks or spills.
  Use container within a container whenever transporting chemicals.

#### VC. GENERAL BIOSAFETY LEVEL II PROCEDURES and TECHNIQUES

**Introduction:** Our lab is a Biosafety Level I lab.
However,
I would like us to treat it as a Biosafety Level II lab.
Working in a Biosafety Level II facility
is fundamentally different than work in a biochemistry laboratory.
Constant attention must be paid
to maintaining a sterile environment for microorganisms
and a clean environment for your own safety.
This section contains a brief summary of aseptic technique
as well as some commonly used procedures.

*Before beginning any biosafety level II microbiological work*,
you must watch and affirm your understanding
of the [use of Biological Safety Cabinets][6]



**Aseptic Technique**

In order to minimize the introduction of contaminants
into the culture environment,
specific procedures and laboratory equipment
have been developed to promote the sterile handling of animal cells.
Bacteria, yeast and fungi
may be introduced to cell cultures
by individuals, the work surface, the atmosphere, and solutions.
The routine application of the following simple rules
together with proper use of equipment
should minimize the likelihood of contamination.

1. Cultures are routinely examined using a microscope every time they are handled.
1. Reagents are checked for sterility before use
   (either by the supplier or the individual user).
1. Bottles of media and sera are not shared or used for different cell lines.
1. Aseptic technique is used at all times.
1. Absolutely no food or drink is allowed in the culture room.

The major workplace for sterile operations is the Biological Safety Cabinet.
The hood protects the working area
from dust and contamination
by a constant, laminar flow of filtered air
passing over the work surface.
The most commonly used type is the vertical flow hood.
In this type of hood air blows down from the top of the cabinet
onto the work area
and is either recirculated (after filtering) or vented.
The hood may contain an ultraviolet light for killing bacteria.
The light should be turned on for a short duration prior to use.
Constant operation overnight is not necessary.
The hood is equipped with outlets
for air, vacuum and natural gas lines.
The hood should be located in a room free from drafts
and devoted exclusively to tissue culture.

The work area in a laminar flow hood
should be kept neat and tidy at all times.
When not in use,
the only items that should remain in the hood
are the pipette tips and automatic pipettor.
Prior to use,
the operator should spray his or her hands and the work area
with 70% (v/v) ethanol.
Allow surfaces sprayed with ethanol to evaporate –
do NOT immediately wipe off.
Alcohol acts as a desiccant
and must be given time to be effective.
Bleached areas should be wiped up thoroughly.
After the work area is cleaned,
treat it as being sterile.
Only those items being used for a particular procedure
(e.g. bottles of media and sera, pipettes, cells, tissue culture ware)
should be brought into the hood.
The outside surface of bottles
should be cleaned with 70% ethanol
prior to introduction into the work area.
The materials should be arranged
so that there is easy access to each item.
Make sure that there is a clear central space
for performing manipulations with cells.
All work should be in the range of vision.
If anything becomes contaminated
(pipettes, bottles, etc.),
discard it.
When finished,
close all bottles
and remove all items brought into the hood.
Finally,
swab the surface with 10% (v/v) bleach and/or 70% (v/v) ethanol.

#### VD. AUTHORSHIP POLICY

- Authorship on scientific publications is based on
  significant contributions to the intellectual input, execution, and writing
  of papers.
  Here is the statement on authorship from the journal *Evolution*:

    > Authorship of a paper carries with it responsibility as well as credit.
      All those whose names appear as authors
      whould have played a significant role
      in designing or carrying out the research, writing the manuscript,
      or providing extensive guidance to the execution of the project.
      They should be able to present and defend the work in a public forum."

- Within the VKC laboratory,
  the PI (Vanja Klepac-Ceraj) has final say on all authorship issues
  for work conducted by lab members in whole or in part
  during one’s tenure in the lab.
  However, as a general guideline,
  the "default" policies are stated below.
  These are subject to change without notice
  and to modification for specific circumstances,
  including but not limited to exceptionally high or minimal contribution
  in one or more areas.
- For all authorship issues,
  provisional authorship may be indicated prior to submission,
  but authorship and author order will not be finalized
  until the time of manuscript submission,
  and that decision falls upon the laboratory PI.
  Provisional authorship or author position
  is no guarantee of authorship or author position on the final submission.
- Regarding standard research publications,
  the criterion for co-authorship is contribution of (100/*X*)%
  in any one or combination of the following three areas:
    - intellectual input
      (including initial design and subsequent modification and development of the project)
    - execution (including data analysis);
    - writing of the paper (including figure and table preparation) for submission.
    - *X* denotes the number of potential authors contributing to the study.
    - We also abide by the *Evolution* criterion
      that all authors should be able to present and defend all the work,
      not just their piece of the work,
      in a public forum.
      Such a presentation should include accurate and thorough discussion
      of the relation of the work to other published studies on the topic.
      There must have been at least some detectable intellectual input and engagement;
      one cannot have been merely a "lab-hand" in the execution of the study.
- To be considered for "first author",
  the researcher must have contributed >50% of the writing of the final draft
  as well as to either the intellectual input or execution of the project.
  If the paper drafts given to the PI are so poorly prepared
  (as determined by the PI) that rewriting from scratch is easier than editing,
  first authorship by the writer is forfeited.
  The first author has no more than 6 months from the end of data collection
  for a particular publication, as determined by the lab PI,
  to prepare the paper draft.
  Failure to produce a well-prepared draft in this timeframe
  may forfeit the right to first-authorship.
