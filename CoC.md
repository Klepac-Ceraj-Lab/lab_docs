# Code of Conduct

## Expectations

The following are expectations that your mentors (Kevin and Vanja) have
for everyone associated with the lab.

### Overall

My goal is to help everyone in this group become productive, c
reative and independent scientists.
The qualities I require for people joining our lab are:
- **Passion:**
your work has to get you out of bed in the morning
- **Kindness:**
taking action to help others in the lab
and to be a supportive member of our community
- **Self-direction:** I am hands-off. I want you to work independently and come to me when you have questions.
- **Rigor:**
Your work should be reproducible, accessible, and clearly thought out.
I want you to present your work clearly and succinctly.
- **Participation:**
I want you to help others,
to share ideas and thoughts with others in the lab.
I also want you to stay on top of literature.
- **Completing projects:**
Papers are currency.
Although you are an undergraduate,
it matters if your work is published.
This is the only community record of the work that you have done.

### Safety

[Original Source][1]

**I care deeply about**
**the physical and mental health**
**of the people that work in and around our lab.**
**Beyond your own safety,**
**failure to follow proper laboratory practices**
**could put the safety of other lab members**
**and the viability of the lab as an entity into jeopardy.**

- Familiarize yourself with the lab’s chemical hygiene plan
- Follow the plan
- If you need personal protective equipment (PPE), order it.
Or ask Sophie to order it.
- If your health status changes,
tell me in private so that we can investigate
how this might affect your ability to work in the lab
- If you see someone acting in an unsafe manner,
remind them that they need to do X

### Research

- Effort
    - Being present is not the same as working.
    - Take charge of your project. You are the expert.
    - I don’t care when you are physically here but I insist
    that you are a good lab citizen and productive researcher.

- Research
    - Zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism and data fabrication.
    - Give me a weekly update on last week’s effort, <!-- TODO: Add to SoPs -->
    plans for the next week, and progress towards achieving long term goals.
    - Present at a meeting/conferences each year.
    Please give me complete slides 10 days in advance of talk.
    - Apply for any and all funding that is available for research and travel.

- Writing
    - Write at least a half hour per day. Just write.

- Citizenship
    - Share your life/lab hacks with other members of the lab.
    - Give information about career development opportunities as you learn of them.
    - Provide support to colleagues in the lab by reading drafts,
    engaging in discussions, and being a positive influence.
    - Acknowledge and build off the work of others in the lab.

## PI Expectations

The following are expectations of the lab PI that students can count on.
I promise to:

- Care. About you and about your work.
- Get and keep funding.
- Do everything I can to mentor you to be a productive scientist.
- Consult the lab when new people are interested in joining us.
- Review drafts within 24-48 hours of receiving them.
- Meet with you individually weekly. <!-- TODO: add to SoP -->
- Give information about career development and funding opportunities
as we learn of them.
- Be your biggest advocate.
- Nominate you for awards as appropriate.
- Support you to attend one conference per year assuming you are presenting.
- Direct you along a project that is capable of generating a paper.
- Include you in ancillary papers as your availability permits.
- Be enthusiastic about everyone’s project.
- Protect confidences.
I may seek mentoring advice from people I respect
and will always do so with your best interest in mind.
- Do our best to maintain a team of scientists
that is demographically and scientifically diverse.
- If you think that we have broken our promises,
then you have the right to call me on it.
If you do not think that is likely to be productive,
you should contact departmental chair.

## Student expectations

The following are expectations
for students that join the lab.
Students should promise to:

- Pass your courses.
- Develop the concepts of your project (with mentors)
and write it up independently
- Complete and keep an up-to-date project plan. <!-- TODO: add to SoP -->
- Communicate your career goals as they develop. <!-- TODO: Add SoP on IDP -->
- As a more senior student in the lab,
look for opportunities to mentor lab newbies.
- Work 9-11 hours per week during the semester.
- Keep up with literature and stay excited about your project.
Own and drive it.

## Staff

- You report directly to me.
If anyone asks you to do anything,
tell them you need to talk to me first
- You will have a research project and you will work on it with my direction
- Work with me to develop a project
- Although you have paused your formal training,
I still expect you to continue to develop skills while you work in the lab
- You will probably be asked to entertain far more of my crazy ideas
than anyone else in the lab
- When you start, you should have a good idea of where your career is going,
communicate with me so that I can help you work toward your goals <!-- TODO: add to IDP SoP -->
