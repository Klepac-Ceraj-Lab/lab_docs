# Storing samples and supplies in a freezer

## Labeling conventions
**All boxes should be labeled with your initials (ABC), date (at least MM/YY), and project name (ECHO, Green Lake, Global Flora, etc.)**

For labeling freezer boxes, use the [DYMO LabelWriter450](https://www.dymo.com/en-US/labelwriter-450-label-printer) to print a pair of [DTCR-6000 labels](https://www.divbio.com/product/dtcr-6000) (for the top and side of the box).
