# Storing samples and supplies in a freezer

## Labeling conventions
**All boxes should be labeled with
your initials (ABC), date (at least MM/YY),
and project name (ECHO, Green Lake, Global Flora, etc.)**

For labeling freezer boxes, use the [DYMO LabelWriter450][dymo-printer]
to print a pair of [DTCR-6000 labels][dymo-labels]
(for the top and side of the box).

The DYMO printer application is installed on `rosalind` on the `vkclab` user.

### Color conventions

Use the following table to determine which color label to use:

| Color  | Cat. No.    | Category                                                           |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Blue   | DTCR-6000-B | Original environmental sample (soil, biofilm, feces, saliva, etc.) |
| Red    | DTCR-6000-R | Extracted nucleotides (gDNA, RNA)                                  |
| Green  | DTCR-6000-G | Glycerol stocks                                                    |
| Yellow | DTCR-6000-Y | Reagents                                                           |
| Orange | DTCR-6000-O | Other extracted macromolecules (protein)                           |
| White  | DTCR-6000-W | Miscellaneous                                                      |

## Storage box conventions

If using standard 1-2 ml eppendorf tubes or cryovials, use a
[cardboard cryobox][cyrobox] with an 81-cell divider.
These boxes and dividers can be found in the cabinet under the bench
to the right of the sink in L307.

## Individual tube labeling

Tubes should be labeled *at least* on the side with
your initials (ABC), date (MM/DD), and unique sample label.
These can written directly on the side of the tube or written or printed onto a
[Tough Tag][tough-tags] (see below for [printing instructions](#printing-labels)).

If desired, the tops of tubes can be labeled further
with [Tough Spots][tough-spots].
A label on the tube cap is meant to make it easier to quickly identify a sample
without taking the entire tube out of the box.
Use this knowledge to guide what you write on the small spot labels.

## Documenting location in a freezer

The VKC Lab owns 3 freezers: two -80˚C and one -20˚C.
The -80˚C freezer next to L305 *check room number* is designated for **ECHO Samples ONLY**.
The -80˚C freezer in L306A is designated for all other lab project storage.

*Name individual freezers?*
*Possible options: Balto, Yeti, Frosty*
*National parks?: Acadia, Dinali, Yosemite, Zion, Grand Teton, Mount Rainier*

When putting a new box in any of these freezers,
note where the box is being placed by labeling the white board
on the front of each freezer.
Then fill out [this form][freezer-form] to update our freezer inventory.

### General organization of shelves in L306A -80˚C

*TBD*
