# VKC Lab Meetings

The VKC Lab meets once a week during the fall and spring semesters.
Time and location varies (see [below](#schedule)).

Generally, [an agenda](#agendas) is shared on the `#general` channel
on the `VKC-Lab` Slack at the beginning of each week.
We discuss lab business and one or two lab members
give a 10-15 minute [presentation](#presentations) on their work.

## Schedule
