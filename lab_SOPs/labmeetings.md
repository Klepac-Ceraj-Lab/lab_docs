# VKC Lab Meetings

The VKC Lab meets once a week during the fall and spring semesters. Time and location varies (see [below](#schedule)).

Generally, [an agenda](#agendas) is shared on the `#general` channel on the `VKC-Lab` Slack at the beginning of each week. We discuss lab business and one or two lab members give a 10-15 minute [presentation](#presentations) on their work.

## Schedule

The schedule for lab meetings can be found in [this Airtable view](https://airtable.com/shrhkxQgCqwWbmQvW). It can also be [exported as a calendar format](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/225050348-Integrating-Airtable-with-external-calendar-applications-e-g-Google-Calendar-Microsoft-Outlook-Apple-Calendar-) which can be added to iCal or Google Calendar.

## Agendas

All lab agendas can be found in `VKC LAB > Lab Meetings > Agendas`. Starting in spring 2020, agendas for each semester will be organized in one running document labeled `S/F YYYY Agenda`.

## Presentations

A copy of each lab presentation should be saved to `VKC LAB > Lab Meetings > Meeting Presentations` and named with the format `YYYY-MM-DD YOURNAME`.
