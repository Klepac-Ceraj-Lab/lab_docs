# Onboarding new students

## Access to lab applications

All students should have access to the following:
1. `VKC LAB` folder on Google Drive
2. `Klepac-Ceraj Group` Google calendar
3. `VKC-Lab` on Slack
    * All students should be added to `#general` channel to start
    * Other generally relevant channels include
    `#papers`, `#random`, and `#resources`

## Access to `ada` for new students

We have two lab computers: `ada` and `rosalind`.
`ada` is our primary computational machine.
Use the following lines of code to
create a new user
and set up ssh (i.e. remote access).

```sh
adduser --ingroup students $USER
```

Get public key,
and add to `/home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## Physical access

All students should have swipe access to L-wing.
If this is not the case, Vanja can share their student B number with
*insert admin name* and ask that the student be granted after-hour access.

All students will be given a designated third of a shelf in L307.
These can be designated with a piece of colored lab tape with their name.

All students who will be doing any wet-lab work
should also be given a new [lab notebook][notebook-amazon].

## Individual documents and folders on Google Drive

Students should create their own folder in
`VKC LAB > Personal & Project Folders > FIRSTNAME LASTNAME 'YY`
('YY = class year)
for storing any miscellaneous documents related to their research.

Students should create their own running agenda for their weekly meetings in
`VKC LAB > Individual Weekly Meetings`.
This can be done by making a duplicate of `WeeklyAgenda_TEMPLATE`
and renaming it `WeeklyAgenda_YOURNAME`.

## Member information for Airtable and [the lab website](https://www.vkclab.com/)

All students should fill out the
[new member form](https://airtable.com/shr3kbs51ADf4ztJA)
within a week of joining the lab.

*Note: all lab members should be reminded at the beginning of every semester
to fill out the form if any information requires updating.*

This form will populate
[this list](https://airtable.com/shrxfBjuMkFFTd1E8) on Airtable.

*Note: if a members answers aren't appearing,
it may be because a staff member has not designated
`Yes` in the `Use this version?` column
which allows older, out-of-date submissions to be filtered out.

**FOR STAFF**: The answers to this form should be used
to update the [lab website](https://www.vkclab.com/our-team)
no later than *one month* within the member joining.
